# Configs

My configurations for 
- Powershell (pwsh)
- Windows-Terminal
- Scoop
- nvim (still to be automated)

Step1: In Windows Powershell execute:
```Powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Step2: adjust packages/modules as needed and execute the setup script 
```Powershell
setup_all.ps1
```
